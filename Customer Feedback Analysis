## Customer Feedback Analysis: Insights and Recommendations

**Goal**  
Evaluate customer feedback ratings to identify areas for improvement in service or product quality.

**Key Question**  
What are the average customer ratings, and what specific feedback comments correlate with the lower ratings?

To find this out, I ran the following query:

```sql
SELECT 
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name,
    f.feedback_date,
    f.rating,
    f.comments
FROM 
    Customers c
JOIN 
    Feedback f ON c.customer_id = f.customer_id;

In return, it revealed the following:

Results:

	•	Alice Brown:
Feedback Date: 2023-06-01
Rating: 5
Comments: “Excellent Service!”
	•	Bob Davis:
Feedback Date: 2023-06-02
Rating: 4
Comments: “Very good, but could improve.”
	•	Charlie Evans:
Feedback Date: 2023-06-03
Rating: 2
Comments: “Not satisfied with the product quality.”

Analysis

	•	Positive Feedback: Alice provided the highest rating (5) with positive comments, indicating satisfaction with the service quality.
	•	Mixed Feedback: Bob rated the service a 4 and suggested improvements, indicating while he was satisfied, there are areas that need enhancement.
	•	Negative Feedback: Charlie’s feedback is concerning, with a rating of 2 and dissatisfaction regarding product quality.

To improve customer satisfaction by analyzing feedback to identify strengths and areas for improvement, here are my recommendations:

	1.	Maintain High Standards of Service: Since Alice’s feedback highlights excellent service, it’s important to maintain and encourage these standards among staff to ensure continued customer satisfaction.
	2.	Address Improvement Areas: For Bob’s feedback, gather more specific details on what aspects could be improved. This might involve surveys or follow-up communications to understand customer needs better.
	3.	Investigate Product Quality Issues: Charlie’s negative feedback suggests that there may be significant quality issues with the products. Conduct an internal review of the product line to identify potential causes and implement quality control measures.
	4.	Customer Follow-Up: Implement a system for following up with customers after their purchase to address any potential issues and gather additional feedback.
	5.	Engage Customers with Promotions: Consider promotions or incentives for customers who leave feedback to encourage more participation and engagement.

Note: This analysis is limited to the available data and will not be updated in the future.
