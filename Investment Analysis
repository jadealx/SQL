## Goal of the Analysis

Assess the overall performance of investment portfolios by analyzing total investments, average portfolio values, and identifying high-performing investments, particularly in the stock category.

## Total Investment Analysis

I wanted to find out what is the total amount invested by each user? Are there any trends in investment amounts across different user demographics (e.g., age or risk tolerance)?

To do this, I ran the following query:

```sql
SELECT u.name, SUM(i.amount_invested) AS total_invested
FROM Users u
JOIN Portfolios p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
JOIN Investments i ON p.portfolio_id = i.portfolio_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.name;

This revealed the following:

	•	Alice invested a total amount of $225,000
	•	Bob invested $50,000
	•	Carol invested $8,000

I wanted to see the total amount invested by age group, so I then ran the following query:

SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN age BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN '30-39'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 40 AND 49 THEN '40-49'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS age_group,
    SUM(i.amount_invested) AS total_invested
FROM Users u
JOIN Portfolios p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
JOIN Investments i ON p.portfolio_id = i.portfolio_id
GROUP BY age_group;

Which revealed:

	•	The age group 30-39 invested a total of $233,000
	•	The age group 40-49 invested $50,000

I also wanted to see if there’s a trend based on risk tolerance, so I also ran this query:

SELECT 
    u.risk_tolerance,
    SUM(i.amount_invested) AS total_invested
FROM Users u
JOIN Portfolios p ON u.user_id = p.user_id
JOIN Investments i ON p.portfolio_id = i.portfolio_id
GROUP BY u.risk_tolerance;

Which revealed:

	•	High Risk Tolerance: $225,000
	•	Medium Risk Tolerance: $50,000
	•	Low Risk Tolerance: $8,000

Recommendations

For High Risk Tolerance Investors, like Alice:

	•	Encourage investment in high-growth stocks, technology companies, and possibly cryptocurrencies.
	•	Suggest diversifying into international markets or sectors expected to experience significant growth.

Portfolio Considerations

	•	Consider creating portfolios that emphasize capital appreciation over income, which aligns with their high risk appetite.

For Medium Risk Tolerance Investors, like Bob:

	•	Recommend a balanced mix of stocks and bonds, focusing on stable dividend-paying stocks and moderate-risk mutual funds.
	•	Include some exposure to high-risk assets for potential growth, but maintain a safety net through safer investments.

Portfolio Considerations

	•	Portfolio diversification should be a priority, ensuring they are not overly exposed to any single sector.

For Low Risk Tolerance Investors, like Carol:

	•	Recommend conservative investments such as government bonds, fixed deposits, or high-quality corporate bonds.
	•	Focus on income-generating assets that provide stability rather than growth.

Portfolio Considerations

	•	Emphasize capital preservation and lower volatility, which aligns with their risk tolerance.
