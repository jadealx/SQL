## Course Projects
The projects labeled with a completion date of two months ago or more were part of an online data analytics course. These projects have been intentionally left untouched to showcase my learning curve and growth since then. While they were instrumental in building my foundation, my more recent personal projects reflect my current skills and understanding.
