# Investment Analysis Project

## Overview
- Conducted an in-depth analysis of investment data across multiple portfolios.
- Utilized advanced SQL techniques including JOINs, CTEs, and aggregate functions.

### Key Insights
1. **Average Investment Value by Portfolio:**
   - Calculated the average value of investments within each portfolio as of the most recent performance date.
2. **Total Investment Value by Investor:**
   - Aggregated the total value of investments per investor, providing insights into individual investment behaviors.
3. **Investments with High Returns:**
   - Identified investments yielding returns greater than 10% as of the latest performance date.

### SQL Techniques Used
- **JOINS:** Linked data across `Investors`, `Portfolios`, `Investments`, and `Performance` tables.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Simplified complex queries by breaking them down into manageable parts.
- **Subqueries:** Used subqueries to retrieve specific data points, such as the latest performance date for each investment.
- **Aggregate Functions:** Employed functions like `AVG` and `SUM` to calculate average and total values.
- **Filtering with LIKE and Wildcards (%):** Applied pattern matching to filter and analyze specific data entries.

### Business Application
- This analysis provides valuable insights for investment managers to understand portfolio performance, identify high-performing investments, and evaluate investor behaviors. These insights can inform strategic investment decisions, optimize portfolio management, and enhance investor relations.
