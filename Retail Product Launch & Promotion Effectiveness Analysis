Goal:

Examine the impact of promotions on customer spending behavior and reward redemption.

Question:

How do different promotional campaigns influence customer spending patterns and reward redemption rates?

Analysis:

To do this, I ran the following query:

SELECT 
    p.promotionname,
    SUM(s.totalamount) AS total_spending,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.customerid) AS unique_customers,
    COUNT(s.saleid) AS total_sales
FROM 
    Promotions p
JOIN 
    Sales s ON p.promotionid = s.promotionid
GROUP BY 
    p.promotionname
ORDER BY 
    total_spending DESC;

Which in return, revealed the following:

	•	Promotion Name: Summer Sale
	•	Total Spending: $68.00
	•	Unique Customers: 2
	•	Total Sales: 2
This indicates that the summer sale was moderately successful, attracting two customers who each made a purchase.
	•	Promotion Name: August Discount
	•	Total Spending: $36.00
	•	Unique Customers: 1
	•	Total Sales: 1
The August discount had a lower total spending and only attracted one customer, suggesting that it might not have been as effective as the summer sale.

Recommendations

	•	Evaluate the Effectiveness of Promotions: Since the summer sale had a higher total spending and more customers, consider replicating its strategies (e.g., marketing channels, discount rates, etc.) for future promotions.
	•	Test and Optimize: Since the August discount had lower engagement, consider adjusting its structure. For example, testing different discount percentages, promotional messaging, or marketing approaches could improve results.
	•	Promote Successful Campaigns: Utilize the success of the summer sale as a case study to encourage further promotion of similar campaigns. This could involve highlighting customer testimonials or successful purchases.
	•	Feedback Loop: Collect customer feedback on both promotions to identify what worked well and what could be improved. This can provide valuable insights for future promotions.

Limitations

	•	Data Scope: The analysis is based on a limited set of promotional campaigns and customer transactions, which may not provide a comprehensive view of customer behavior across all promotions.
	•	Time Frame: The promotional campaigns analyzed were conducted over a short period, limiting the ability to assess long-term trends and customer loyalty.
	•	Lack of Qualitative Data: The analysis focuses solely on quantitative metrics, which may overlook important qualitative factors such as customer sentiment, satisfaction, and feedback that could influence spending behavior.
