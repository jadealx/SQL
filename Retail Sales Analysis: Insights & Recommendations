-- Focus is on customer segmentation and sales analysis for a retail business

-- The goal is to analyze customer purchase behaviour, sales performance, and propose actionable recommendations based on the data.

-- I ran the following query to find the most popular products

SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(t.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM 
    products p
JOIN 
    transactions t ON p.product_id = t.product_id
GROUP BY 
    p.product_name
ORDER BY 
    total_sold DESC;

-- The results showed that Coffee Machine were a high demand product, marking 3 as total sold. T shirt comes in at 2 in total being sold, followed by smartphone, laptop, and sneakers all only having 1 sold each.

-- I then wanted to find out, why were coffee machines being sold more than the other products?

-- So I then ran the following query to see a price comparison of the products

SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    p.price
FROM 
    products p
WHERE 
    p.product_name IN ('Coffee Machine', 'Laptop', 'Smartphone', 'Sneakers', 'T-shirt');

-- This revealed to me the following

-- Coffee Machine ($49.99): This is significantly lower than the other products. Its affordability may contribute to its higher sales volume, appealing to a broader audience.
-- Smartphone ($699.99) and Laptop ($999.99): These higher-priced items might attract a different, more budget-conscious demographic, especially in comparison to the coffee machine.
-- T-Shirt ($19.99) and Sneakers ($79.99): These prices suggest a more casual purchase mindset, likely with less commitment than electronics.

-- Market Positioning:
-- The coffee machine being the most affordable option could explain its higher sales, especially if customers are looking for value. In contrast, more expensive items may require more consideration before purchase.

-- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Analysis: To better understand potential long-term revenue, I calculated the average number of purchases, the average amount spent per customer, and the estimated CLV

SELECT 
    AVG(t.quantity) AS avg_purchases_per_customer,
    AVG(t.total_amount) AS avg_spent_per_customer,
    AVG(t.total_amount) * 3 AS estimated_clv
FROM 
    transactions t;

-- Average Purchases per Customer: 1.0
-- Average Amount Spent per Customer: $393.98
-- Estimated CLV: $1,181.95

-- This analysis provides insights into each customerâ€™s potential value over time, allowing for more strategic decisions on marketing and promotions.

-- Reommendations
--  If the coffee machine is selling well due to its price, consider promoting it more heavily. Marketing efforts could highlight affordability and value by offering a limited-time discount or bundling it with related products (like mugs or coffee beans). Additionally, promotions during holidays or back-to-school seasons could appeal to college students, teachers, or remote workers.

-- Measuring Success
-- Surveys and Reviews: After the promotion, send surveys to customers who purchased the coffee machine or the bundle, asking if the promotion influenced their decision.
-- Repeat Purchases: Track any increase in repeat purchases from customers who participated in the promotion to assess satisfaction and brand loyalty.
-- Return on Investment (ROI): Calculate the promotion's cost against the revenue generated to determine financial viability.
