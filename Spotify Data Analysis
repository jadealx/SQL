-- In this analysis, I explored a dataset of Spotify tracks to uncover insights about various musical attributes. The dataset includes information on track names, artists, popularity, and several audio features such as danceability, energy, and tempo.

    -- The analysis involved:
        Identifying the most popular tracks and comparing their attributes.
        Exploring patterns in danceability and energy levels across different tracks.
        Categorizing tracks based on their loudness and tempo to understand their distribution.
        Finally, comparing tracks with high and low popularity to identify distinctive features.
